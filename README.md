# Movie Tracker

## Description

Movie Tracker was a three group project created using React, Redux and Router to display components from a movie API completed in nine days. On the loading page of the app, it displays a list of currently playing films and allows the user to either sign in or create a new account. Once logged in, the user then has the ability to add and remove favorites and then view their favorites.
