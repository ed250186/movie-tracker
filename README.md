# Movie Tracker

## Description

Movie Tracker was a group project created using React, Redux and Router to display components from a movie API. On the loading page of the app, it displays a list of currently playing films and allows the user to either sign in or create a new account. Once logged in, the user then has the ability to add and remove favorites and then view their favorites.

## Installation - Front-End

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emilydittmer/movie-tracker.git

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash

```

To view the app in action, run the following command in your terminal:

Then, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see the code running in the browser.
